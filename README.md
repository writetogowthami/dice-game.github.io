Game Rules
1. The dice game has 2 players, rolling a dice in rounds
2. Rule 1: If a player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
3. In each turn, a player rolls dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score(unless it's a 1)
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his global score. After that, it's the next player's turn
5. The first player to reach 20 points on GLOBAL score wins the game ("WINNER"). You can reset the GLOBAL score by setting a final score
